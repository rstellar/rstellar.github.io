## What's this?

This is the shiny new Ghost admin UI built in Ember.js. It gets served if you visit the URL `/ghost/ember/`.

We're currently in the process of building this awesome new UI to replace the old one which was written in backbone,
lives in the `/clientold/` folder and is still served when you visit the URL `/ghost/`.

In short, we currently have 2 admins:

* Old, Backbone Admin UI lives in `/clientold/` and is served from `/ghost/`
* New, Ember Admin UI lives in `/client/` and is served from `/ghost/ember/`
